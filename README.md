# ODDEA Quantitative Analysis of Digitalization Indexes

## Indexes

- ADII (ASEAN Digital Integration Index): South-East Asia, values available for 6 pillars, only 2021

- DESI (Digital Economy and Society Index): EU, granulated and longitudinal data, summed up into 4 pillars

- DII (Digital Intelligence Index): Global, values available for 4 pillars, only 2019

- [?] WDCI (World Digital Competitiveness Index): Global, longitudinal, only a few indicators available


## IDEA

- The analysis of comparability at pillars' level.
- How it affects the un/comparability of whole indexes?
- How the construction of indexes responds to theories of different aspects of digitalization?

## Basic correlations

- ADII x DII (South-East Asia): 0.93, 12 observations

- ADII x WDCI (South-East Asia): 0.88, 9 observations

- DESI x WDCI (EU): 0.67, 50 observations

- EDCI x DII (World): 0.73, 52 observations

### Problems (TO DO)

- Map out country codes (in DESI) to country names, to merge this dataset with DII
- Make sure all countries have matching names in all datasets (e.g. Czechia and Czech Republic)


## Comparison at pillar level

We could find matching pillars from different indexes by correlating them (e.g. which pillar from ADII is correlated with DII's Demand pillar?). The problem is, even within one index the pillars are highly correlated. So if DII's Demand correlates with ADII's Innovation at 0.93, it could mean they express a similar concept, but also that Demand drives Innovation and so on.

### Problems (TO DO)

- Think through possible technical solutions (orthogonalization, PCA?)
 
## Theoretical analysis (TO DO):

- Decide on the basic pillars
- Prepare literature review for each pillar
